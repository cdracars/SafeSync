## 🚀 What SafeSync Does

SafeSync is the **"set it and forget it"** backup solution for your important files.

- **🎯 Universal folder backup** - Works with ANY folder containing important files
- **🤖 Auto-detects 3D printing configs** - OrcaSlicer, PrusaSlicer, Klipper, and more
- **⚡ One-command setup** - `./easy-setup.sh --orcaslicer` and you're done
- **🔍 Real-time monitoring** - Watches folders for changes using system tools
- **📝 Automatic Git commits** - Every change gets timestamped and committed
- **☁️ Cloud backup** - Pushes to GitHub/GitLab for off-machine safety
- **⏰ Scheduled safety net** - Cron jobs ensure nothing is missed
- **🌐 Cross-platform** - Linux, Windows (WSL), macOS

**The philosophy:** Point it at a folder, and that folder stays backed up forever.

## 🎯 Perfect For

### 🖨️ 3D Printing (Our Specialty)
- **Slicer configurations** - OrcaSlicer, PrusaSlicer profiles and settings
- **Klipper setups** - printer.cfg, macros, mesh data (use KIAUH for Pi setup)
- **Printer firmware** - Marlin configs, OctoPrint settings
- **Spoolman/Docker** - docker-compose.yml and database backups

### 💻 Development & Gaming
- **Important config dirs** - `~/.config/someapp`, dotfiles, IDE settings

- Commits changes with timestamp: "Automatic backup YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
- Pushes to remote repository
- Handles push failures gracefully (commits locally)
- Supports verbose output and dry-run mode
</details>

<details>
<summary>👁️ monitor.sh</summary>

- Uses `inotifywait` (Linux/WSL) or `fswatch` (macOS) to watch files
- Waits 10 seconds after detecting changes (configurable)
- Calls `backup.sh` to create commit and push
- Runs continuously until stopped (Ctrl+C)
- Excludes common temporary files (.tmp, .log, etc.)
</details>

<details>
<summary>⏰ install-cron.sh</summary>

- Sets up cron jobs for scheduled backups
- Default: every 4 hours, customizable
- Creates log files in `~/.safesync/logs/`
- Can list existing jobs or remove backup jobs
- Validates backup system before installing cron job
</details>

## 📦 Installation Requirements

### Linux/WSL
```bash
sudo apt install git inotify-tools    # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install git inotify-tools    # RHEL/CentOS
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install git fswatch
```

# Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

### HTTPS (Alternative)
The setup script will prompt for GitHub username and offer both SSH and HTTPS options.

## 🎮 Manual Commands

```bash
# Easy setup wizard (recommended)
./easy-setup.sh                    # Simple guided setup

# Manual backup operations
./backup.sh /path/to/folder         # One-time backup
./backup.sh /path/to/folder --verbose  # Verbose output

# File monitoring
./monitor.sh /path/to/folder &      # Start real-time monitoring

# Scheduled backups
./install-cron.sh /path/to/folder   # Every 4 hours (default)
./install-cron.sh /path/to/folder 2 # Every 2 hours
./install-cron.sh --list           # View current backup jobs
./install-cron.sh --remove         # Remove all backup jobs
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>🏗️ "Repository needs to be created manually"</summary>

SafeSync can create repositories automatically if you have GitHub CLI:

```bash
# If you missed it during setup, install GitHub CLI:
# Ubuntu/Debian:
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh

# macOS:
brew install gh

# Then authenticate and create repository:
gh auth login
gh repo create your-repo-name --public

# Manual option - Use GitHub web interface:
# Go to: https://github.com/new
# Create repository with the name shown in the setup output
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🚫 "Git push failed"</summary>

```bash
# Check if remote repository exists
git remote -v

# Test SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# Try manual push
cd /your/folder && git push origin master
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 "inotifywait: command not found" (Linux)</summary>

```bash
sudo apt install inotify-tools
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🍎 "fswatch: command not found" (macOS)</summary>

```bash
brew install fswatch
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>📝 "No changes detected" but files changed</summary>

```bash
# Check git status manually
cd /your/folder && git status

# Check .gitignore isn't excluding everything
cat .gitignore
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>👀 Monitor script stops working</summary>

```bash
# Check if it's still running
ps aux | grep monitor.sh

# Restart monitoring
./monitor.sh /path/to/folder &
```
</details>

### 📄 Log Locations
- **Cron logs**: `~/.safesync/logs/backup-*.log`
- **System cron**: `grep CRON /var/log/syslog` (Linux)
- **Monitor logs**: Check terminal output where monitor.sh was started

## ✅ Real-World Testing

### What We Actually Tested
- ✅ OrcaSlicer configs on Windows WSL
- ✅ Klipper configs on Raspberry Pi
- ✅ Spoolman Docker setup with database dumps
- ✅ Multiple printers with separate repos
- ✅ Cross-platform file monitoring
- ✅ Cron job scheduling and reliability

### Performance Notes
- **Small config files** (< 1MB): Works perfectly
- **Medium collections** (1-50MB): Works well with .gitignore
- **Large binary files**: Use .gitignore to exclude or consider Git LFS
- **Database files**: Set up proper dump scripts

## 💭 Why SafeSync Exists

**Because your carefully tuned configs are irreplaceable.**

Started as a solution for 3D printing enthusiasts who spent hours perfecting their slicer settings, only to lose them to corrupted profiles or system crashes. 

**The core insight:** Most "important" files are small configs that change occasionally - perfect for Git.

**The evolution:** What works for printer profiles works for game saves, development configs, documentation, and any folder containing files you can't afford to lose.

**The philosophy:** Point SafeSync at a folder → It stays backed up forever.

No complex setup, no learning curve, no maintenance. Just reliable, automatic backups of the files that matter to you.
